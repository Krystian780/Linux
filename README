Frist we change directory to --> cd /var/log

We archive .gz directory and all subderictories --> tar -zcvf backup.tgz *.gz

We move the folder with archived backup to Desktop (we can move it whenver we want, i just gave Desktop as default : ) ) 

Then whenever the script is run a text file named with the current date is created that shows what is inside log directory.
